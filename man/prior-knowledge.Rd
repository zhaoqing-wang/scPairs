\title{Prior Knowledge Integration for Synergistic Gene Pair Discovery}
\description{
Integrates biological prior knowledge databases to shift the scoring
from pure co-expression towards functional synergy.  Three complementary
evidence layers are provided:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Prior interaction score} -- direct gene-gene functional annotation
overlap from GO, KEGG, and curated interaction databases.
\item \strong{Pathway bridge score} -- indirect synergy through shared intermediary
genes that connect the pair in biological pathways AND are expressed in
the current dataset.
\item \strong{Neighbourhood synergy score} -- directional enrichment of gene B in
the biological neighbourhood of gene A-expressing cells, capturing
paracrine/juxtacrine interactions even when the two genes are never
co-detected in the same cell.
}

These scores are designed to up-weight gene pairs with biological plausibility
for functional synergy, even when cell-level co-expression is weak or absent.
