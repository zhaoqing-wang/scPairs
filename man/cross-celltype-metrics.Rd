\title{Cross-cell-type interaction metrics}
\description{
Standard co-expression metrics measure whether two genes are expressed
together in the \strong{same} cell.  However, many biologically important
interactions operate \strong{across} cell types -- gene A expressed in one cell
type signals to (or synergises with) gene B expressed in a neighbouring cell
of a different type.  Classic examples include Adora2a--Ido1 trans-cellular
signalling and ligand--receptor pairs.
}
\details{
This module provides a \strong{cross-cell-type interaction score} that detects
such trans-cellular synergies.  For every ordered pair of cell types
(type_i, type_j where i != j), we measure:

\enumerate{
\item The mean expression of gene A in cells of type_i whose neighbours
include cells of type_j.
\item The mean expression of gene B in those type_j neighbour cells.
\item The correlation of these boundary expression levels across all
type_i -> type_j neighbour pairs.
}

The final \strong{cross-cell-type score} aggregates this signal over all
cell-type pairs, capturing whether gene A in one cell type co-varies with
gene B in a neighbouring cell type (and vice versa).
