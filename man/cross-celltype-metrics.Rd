\title{Cross-cell-type interaction metrics}
\description{
Standard co-expression metrics measure whether two genes are expressed
together in the \strong{same} cell.  However, many biologically important
interactions operate \strong{across} cell types -- gene A expressed in one cell
type signals to (or synergises with) gene B expressed in a neighbouring cell
of a different type.  Classic examples include Adora2a--Ido1 trans-cellular
signalling and ligand--receptor pairs.
}
\details{
This module provides a \strong{cross-cell-type interaction score} that detects
such trans-cellular synergies.  The key insight is that "neighbouring" in
this context means cells that could plausibly interact -- \strong{not} cells that
are close in PCA/UMAP space (which groups cells of the \emph{same} type
together).

\strong{Algorithm:}
For each ordered pair of cell types (type_i, type_j where i != j):

\enumerate{
\item Partition cells of each type into \code{n_bins} matched groups
(bins) by splitting the shared PCA embedding into spatial
micro-environments, so that cells in the same bin represent the
same local tissue context.
\item Compute pseudo-bulk expression of gene A in type_i cells per bin,
and pseudo-bulk expression of gene B in type_j cells per bin.
\item Correlate these paired pseudo-bulks across bins.
}

This captures whether tissue regions where type_i cells express high
gene A tend to be regions where type_j cells express high gene B --
exactly the signal expected from paracrine signalling or trans-cellular
co-regulation.
