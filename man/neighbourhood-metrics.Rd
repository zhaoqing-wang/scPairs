\title{Compute neighbourhood-aware co-expression metrics}
\description{
Standard single-cell co-expression methods require two genes to be
detected in the \emph{same} cell.
Due to the inherent sparsity of scRNA-seq (dropout, low capture efficiency)
and the stochastic nature of transcription, many genuinely synergistic gene
pairs are rarely or never co-detected in the same cell -- especially when one
or both genes are expressed at low levels.
}
\details{
This module addresses the problem by leveraging \strong{neighbourhood information}
from the cell-cell similarity graph (typically derived from a UMAP / PCA
embedding or spatial coordinates).  Instead of asking "are these two genes
detected in the same cell?", we ask:

\itemize{
\item \strong{KNN-smoothed correlation} -- After smoothing each gene's expression
over its k nearest neighbours, do the smoothed profiles correlate?
\item \strong{Neighbourhood co-expression score} -- For cells expressing gene A,
are their neighbours enriched for gene B expression (and vice versa)?
\item \strong{Cluster-level (pseudo-bulk) correlation} -- At the cluster
level (aggregated expression), do the two genes correlate?
}

These three metrics form a complementary evidence layer that is particularly
powerful for detecting synergistic pairs where cell-level co-expression is
absent due to technical or biological sparsity.
