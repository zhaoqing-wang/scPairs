\title{Compute pathway bridge score for gene pairs}
\usage{
.bridge_score_batch(pair_dt, prior_net, expressed_genes, min_shared = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{pair_dt}{data.table with gene1, gene2 columns.}

\item{prior_net}{Prior network from \code{.build_prior_network()}.}

\item{expressed_genes}{Character vector of genes expressed in the dataset
(bridge genes must be expressed to be relevant).}

\item{min_shared}{Integer; minimum shared terms between a bridge gene
and each member of the pair.  Default 1.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\describe{
\item{\code{scores}}{Numeric vector of bridge scores.}
\item{\code{bridges}}{List of character vectors; bridge genes for each pair.}
}
}
\description{
For a gene pair (A, B), identifies intermediate "bridge" genes C such that
C shares functional annotations with BOTH A and B, AND C is expressed in
the current dataset.  The bridge score reflects the strength of indirect
connectivity:
}
\details{
\deqn{bridge\_score = \frac{n\_bridges}{\sqrt{|terms_A| \cdot |terms_B|}}}

This captures synergistic relationships where two genes are not directly
co-annotated but are connected through shared pathway intermediaries.
