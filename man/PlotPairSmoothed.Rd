\arguments{
\item{object}{A Seurat object with a dimensionality reduction.}

\item{gene1}{Character; first gene.}

\item{gene2}{Character; second gene.}

\item{reduction}{Character; reduction for plotting.  Default \code{"umap"}.}

\item{smooth_reduction}{Character; reduction for KNN graph.  Default \code{"pca"}.}

\item{k}{Integer; neighbourhood size for smoothing.  Default 20.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric in [0,1]; self-weight for smoothing.  Default 0.3.}

\item{assay}{Character; assay.}

\item{slot}{Character; data slot.}

\item{pt_size}{Numeric; point size.}

\item{pt_alpha}{Numeric; point alpha.}

\item{title}{Character; overall title.}
}
\value{
A combined \code{ggplot} (patchwork) with 6 panels.
}
\description{
A six-panel visualization that shows both raw and KNN-smoothed expression
for a gene pair on the UMAP (or other reduction) embedding.  The top row
shows raw expression (gene1, gene2, product); the bottom row shows
KNN-smoothed expression.  This is particularly informative for gene pairs
that are not co-expressed in the same cell but share neighbourhood-level
co-expression patterns.
