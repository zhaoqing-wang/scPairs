Title: Discover Synergistic Gene Pairs in Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomics
Description: Identifies synergistic gene pairs in single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data by integrating 14 complementary metrics across five evidence layers: cell-level co-expression (Pearson, Spearman, biweight midcorrelation, mutual information, ratio consistency), neighbourhood-aware metrics (KNN-smoothed correlation, neighbourhood co-expression score, cluster-level pseudo-bulk correlation, neighbourhood synergy score), prior biological knowledge (GO/KEGG pathway co-annotation score, pathway bridge score for indirect connections through expressed intermediary genes), trans-cellular interaction (cross-cell-type score for paracrine and ligand-receptor signalling), and spatial co-variation (Lee's L statistic, co-location quotient). Prior knowledge integration shifts discovery from pure co-expression towards functional synergy by incorporating Gene Ontology, KEGG pathway annotations, and user-supplied interaction databases (CellChatDB, CellPhoneDB, SCENIC regulons). Metrics are rank-normalised and combined via weighted summation into a composite synergy score with optional permutation-based p-values and FDR correction. Three workflows are provided: global pair discovery, query-centric partner search, and in-depth pair assessment. Includes publication-ready visualizations including a new synergy network plot showing prior knowledge bridge genes connecting the focal pair.
