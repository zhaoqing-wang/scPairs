Title: Synergistic Gene Pair Discovery in Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomics
Description: Discovers synergistic gene pairs in single-cell RNA-seq and spatial
    transcriptomics data. Integrates 14 metrics across five evidence layers:
    cell-level co-expression (Pearson, Spearman, biweight midcorrelation,
    mutual information, ratio consistency), neighbourhood-aware smoothing
    (KNN-smoothed correlation, neighbourhood co-expression score, cluster
    pseudo-bulk correlation, neighbourhood synergy score), prior biological
    knowledge (GO/KEGG co-annotation score, pathway bridge score),
    trans-cellular interaction (cross-cell-type score), and spatial
    co-variation (Lee's L, co-location quotient). Three unified workflows
    (global discovery, query-centric search, pair-level assessment) share
    a common computation engine with selectable modes: all metrics, expression
    only, or prior knowledge only. All outputs use a consistent data.table
    format and are accepted by every visualization function.
