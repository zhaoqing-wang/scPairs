Title: Discover Synergistic Gene Pairs in Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomics
Description: Identifies synergistic gene pairs in single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data by integrating 11 complementary metrics: cell-level co-expression (Pearson, Spearman, biweight midcorrelation, mutual information, ratio consistency), neighbourhood-aware metrics (KNN-smoothed correlation, neighbourhood co-expression score, cluster-level pseudo-bulk correlation), trans-cellular interaction (cross-cell-type score for paracrine and ligand-receptor signalling), and spatial co-variation (Lee's L statistic, co-location quotient). Metrics are rank-normalised and combined via weighted summation into a composite synergy score with optional permutation-based p-values and FDR correction. Three workflows are provided: global pair discovery, query-centric partner search, and in-depth pair assessment. Includes publication-ready visualizations for networks, heatmaps, UMAP overlays, spatial maps, and cross-cell-type interactions.
