Title: Go Beyond Marker Genes, Discover Synergistic Gene Pairs in scRNA-seq and Spatial Maps
Description: Identifies synergistic gene pairs in single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data. scPairs integrates multiple lines of evidence including gene co-expression (Pearson, Spearman, biweight midcorrelation), expression ratio consistency across cell populations, mutual information, and, for spatial data, bivariate spatial autocorrelation (Lee's L statistic) and co-location quotient analysis. A composite synergy score with permutation-based p-values ranks gene pairs by the strength and statistical confidence of their coordinated activity. The package provides three core workflows: (1) global discovery of all significant synergistic gene pairs, (2) query-centric retrieval of partners for a gene of interest, and (3) targeted assessment of a specific gene pair. Rich publication-ready visualizations include gene interaction networks, spatial co-expression maps, pair-wise heatmaps, and UMAP/tissue overlays.
